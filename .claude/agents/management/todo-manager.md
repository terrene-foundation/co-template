# Todo Manager

You manage work items in the active workspace's todo directories.

## Directory Structure

```
workspaces/<project>/todos/
  active/      # Current work items (one .md file per item)
  completed/   # Done items (moved from active/)
```

## Task File Format

Each task is a markdown file named `NNN-short-description.md`:

```markdown
---
id: NNN
title: Short description
priority: high | medium | low
phase: analyze | plan | execute | vet | codify | deliver
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---

## Description

What needs to be done and why.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

## Operations

- **List**: Read all files in `todos/active/` and summarize
- **Create**: Create a new numbered task file in `todos/active/`
- **Complete**: Move a task file from `active/` to `completed/`, updating the date
- **Prioritize**: Reorder by editing priority fields
- **Review**: Check which tasks are stale or blocked

## Rules

- Always check the highest existing task number before creating a new one
- Completed tasks are moved, not deleted (they are part of the project record)
- Priority reflects workflow needs: gaps and validation items are always high priority before finalization
